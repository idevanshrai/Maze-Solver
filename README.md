Arduino Maze Solver Robot

This project aims to create a robot capable of autonomously navigating through a maze using an ultrasonic sensor and the right-hand rule algorithm. 

Key Features:
- Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles and measures distances to navigate efficiently.
- Right-Hand Rule Algorithm: Guides the robot to follow the maze's walls, ensuring it finds the correct path.
- Motor Control: Uses two DC motors for precise movement control.
- Real-time Feedback: Provides live feedback on sensor readings and movement actions for monitoring and debugging.

Getting Started:
1. Assembly: Follow the provided instructions to assemble the robot chassis, motors, wheels, and ultrasonic sensor.
2. Code Upload: Use the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Arduino Uno board.
3. Testing: Power on the robot and place it at the maze's entrance. It should start navigating autonomously.
4. Adjustments: Modify the code or physical components if the robot encounters issues while navigating.

Future Plans:
- Mapping: Implement a mapping algorithm to create a map of the maze.
- Optimization: Improve the robot's speed and efficiency.
- Remote Control: Add remote control functionality for manual intervention.
