# Maze-Solver
The Arduino Maze Solver Robot is a project aimed at creating an autonomous robot capable of navigating through a maze using an ultrasonic sensor and the right-hand rule algorithm. The robot, built on the Arduino Uno platform, employs two DC motors for movement and an ultrasonic sensor for detecting obstacles.
